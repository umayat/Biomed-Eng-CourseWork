# eStethoscope
The stethoscope is the most commonly used tool in all primary care settings for auscultation of body sounds. Traditional stethoscopes are limited by low sound volume, which makes distinguishing body sounds a difficult task for those who are not trained. The motivation behind this project is to overcome the limitations of traditional stethoscopes.

The eStethoscope is an innovative platform for auscultation of cardiopulmonary and joint sounds. It is designed to serve as a screening and monitoring aid for physicians, and as a learning aid for medical students. Through the eStethoscope we propose taking the auscultated signal into the digital domain opening up a wide range of opportunities:
1. Advance signal processing methods such as filtering, and amplification can be applied for auditory enhancement
2. Pattern recognition helps physicians narrow down the underlying health condition using a database of previously recorded audio signals
